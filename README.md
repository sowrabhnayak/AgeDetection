# AgeDetection
This project is involved with the Detection of the Age and gender of people with different ethnicity, Gender and time span.

What is the aim of the project?
> This projects aims to find the age of the person, irrespective of ethnicity, Gender and time span, by processing the image.

What is the input?
> Image (containing the faces of the people)

What is the Output?
> Age of the faces in the frame.

What algorithm to implement?
>The primary task involves detection of the faces in the image and segmenting them apart.
After detection we need to extract the features for the age detection. For detection of the face we can 
use the popual techniques called vioala jones algorithm which is very efficient in computationally. i have attached the paper here.
